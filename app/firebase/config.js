/*
This line of code is related to Firebase initialization in a Next.js application, particularly in the context of server-side rendering (SSR). Let's break it down:
This line uses a ternary operator to determine whether to initialize a new Firebase app or use an existing one. Here's what it does:
getApps().length: This checks if there are any existing Firebase app instances.
If !getApps().length is true (meaning there are no existing apps):
It calls initializeApp(firebaseConfig) to create a new Firebase app instance.
If !getApps().length is false (meaning there's at least one existing app):
It calls getApp() to retrieve the existing Firebase app instance.
The reason this is important for server-side rendering in Next.js is:
1. Avoiding Multiple Initializations: In a server-side rendered Next.js app, your code might be executed multiple times on the server. Without this check, you might accidentally initialize Firebase multiple times, which can lead to errors.
